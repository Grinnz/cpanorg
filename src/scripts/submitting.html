    <H2>How to submit a script to CPAN</H2>
    <OL>
        <LI><A HREF="../modules/04pause.html">Get a PAUSE ID;</A>
            this is required to upload files to CPAN.
        </LI>
        <LI>Create your script:
            <UL>
                <LI>It must be a single file, not compressed or archived.  This
                    constraint will be relaxed in the future.
                </LI>
                <LI>Insert the appropriate POD sections, as outlined below.
                    (If you don't know what POD is, consult the `perlpod'
                    manpage).  There is one mandatory section, and several
                    useful-but-optional sections.
                </LI>
                <LI>The mandatory POD section is `SCRIPT CATEGORIES'.  The
                    existence of this section informs PAUSE that this is a
                    script.  The contents of this section indicate where the
                    script should be presented in <A HREF="index.html">the
                    categorized hierarchy;</A> currently, you may specify up to
                    three categories for your script.
                </LI>
                <LI>The optional POD section `PREREQUISITES' contains a list
                    of modules which this script <I>requires</I> in order to
                    run.
                </LI>
                <LI>The optional POD section `COREQUISITES' contains a list of
                    modules which this script <I>would benefit from having
                    available,</I> but which are not required.
                </LI>
                <LI>The optional POD section `OSNAMES' contains a list of
                    operating systems (as given in Perl's $^O variable) under
                    which this script will run.
                </LI>
                <LI>The contents of the optional POD section `README' will be
                    automatically extracted and displayed.
                </LI>
            </UL>
        <LI>You may wish to check your script's format against
            <A HREF="../authors/id/K/KS/KSTAR/Sample-0.1">the example
            script.</A>
        </LI>
        <LI>Upload your script to PAUSE.
        <LI>New script categories are <I>not</I> automatically created.  If you
            stipulate a SCRIPT CATEGORIES entry that does not exist, it will
            be silently ignored.  New categories are created via discussion on
            <A HREF="mailto:scripts@perl.org">the scripts mailing list.</A>
            Please join the list before posting to it, by sending an empty
            email to
            <A HREF="mailto:scripts-subscribe@perl.org">scripts-subscribe@perl.org</A>.

    <H2>Contents of POD sections</H2>
    The data in the POD sections, outlined above, must be presented in a
    machine-readable format.  There are two ways to present the data:
    <OL>
        <LI>Unadorned, one item per line.</LI>
        <LI>Embedded in descriptive text, with the data appearing between
            C&lt; and &gt;.</LI>
    </OL>
    <A HREF="../authors/id/K/KS/KSTAR/Sample-0.1">The example script</A>
    contains COREQUISITES, OSNAMES, and SCRIPT CATEGORIES sections in the
    first format, and a PREREQUISITES section in the second format.

    <HR>
    <H2>Improving the process</H2>
    The scripts repository is still being refined.  Please report and problems
    or suggestions to
    <A HREF="mailto:kstar@cpan.org">Kurt Starsinic.</A>
