    How to submit a script to CPAN
</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <a href="../modules/04pause.html">Get a PAUSE ID;</a> this is required to upload files to CPAN.
    </li>
    <li>Create your script:
        <ul>
            <li>It must be a single file, not compressed or archived. This constraint will be relaxed in the future.
            </li>
            <li>Insert the appropriate POD sections, as outlined below. (If you don't know what POD is, consult the `perlpod' manpage). There is one mandatory section, and several useful-but-optional sections.
            </li>
            <li>The mandatory POD section is `SCRIPT CATEGORIES'. The existence of this section informs PAUSE that this is a script. The contents of this section indicate where the script should be presented in <a href="index.html">the categorized hierarchy;</a> currently, you may specify up to three categories for your script.
            </li>
            <li>The optional POD section `PREREQUISITES' contains a list of modules which this script <i>requires</i> in order to run.
            </li>
            <li>The optional POD section `COREQUISITES' contains a list of modules which this script <i>would benefit from having available,</i> but which are not required.
            </li>
            <li>The optional POD section `OSNAMES' contains a list of operating systems (as given in Perl's $^O variable) under which this script will run.
            </li>
            <li>The contents of the optional POD section `README' will be automatically extracted and displayed.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You may wish to check your script's format against <a href="../authors/id/K/KS/KSTAR/Sample-0.1">the example script.</a>
    </li>
    <li>Upload your script to PAUSE.
    </li>
    <li>New script categories are <i>not</i> automatically created. If you stipulate a SCRIPT CATEGORIES entry that does not exist, it will be silently ignored. New categories are created via discussion on <a href="mailto:scripts@perl.org">the scripts mailing list.</a> Please join the list before posting to it, by sending an empty email to <a href="mailto:scripts-subscribe@perl.org">scripts-subscribe@perl.org</a>.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>
    Contents of POD sections
</h2>
<p>
    The data in the POD sections, outlined above, must be presented in a machine-readable format. There are two ways to present the data:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Unadorned, one item per line.
    </li>
    <li>Embedded in descriptive text, with the data appearing between C&lt; and &gt;.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <a href="../authors/id/K/KS/KSTAR/Sample-0.1">The example script</a> contains COREQUISITES, OSNAMES, and SCRIPT CATEGORIES sections in the first format, and a PREREQUISITES section in the second format.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>
    Improving the process
</h2>
<p>
    The scripts repository is still being refined. Please report and problems or suggestions to <a href="mailto:kstar@cpan.org">Kurt Starsinic.</a>
