<h1>How to install CPAN modules</h1>

<p>
    Here are some recommended approaches to installing modules from CPAN, as
    with much of Perl there are several alternatives.
</p>

<h2>
    Some basics
</h2>
<p>
    Most Perl modules are written in Perl, some use <a href=
    "http://perldoc.perl.org/perlxs.html">XS</a> (they are written in <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>) so require a
    C <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a>, see your OS
    of choice below to find out how to get the right compiler. Modules may have
    dependencies on other modules (almost always on <a href=
    "http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>) and cannot be installed without them (or
    without a specific version of them). It is worth throughly reading the
    documentation for the options below. Many modules on CPAN now require a
    recent version of Perl (version 5.8 or above).
</p>

<h2>
    Tools
</h2>
<p>
    To help you install and manage your modules:
</p>
<p>
    <em><a href=
    "http://search.cpan.org/dist/local-lib/">local::lib</a></em> this module enables
    you to install your module in a specified directory without requiring root
    or administrator access. See the <a href=
    "http://search.cpan.org/dist/local-lib/lib/local/lib.pm#The_bootstrapping_technique">
    bootstrapping technique</a> for how to get started. You can create a
    directory per user/project/company and deploy to other servers, by copying the directory
    (as long as you are on the same operating system).
</p>
<p>
    <em><a href=
    "http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-cpanminus/bin/cpanm">cpanm</a></em> from
    <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-cpanminus/">App::cpanminus</a> is
    a script to get, unpack, build and install modules from CPAN. It's
    dependency free (can bootstrap itself) and requires zero configuration. It
    automates the entire build process for the majority of modules on CPAN and
    works well with local::lib and perlbrew. Many experienced Perl developers
    use this as their tool of choice. Related tools: <a href=
    "http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-cpanoutdated/bin/cpan-outdated">cpan-outdated</a>,

    <a href=
    "http://search.cpan.org/dist/cpan-listchanges/bin/cpan-listchanges">cpan-listchanges</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <em><a href=
    "http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-perlbrew/bin/perlbrew">perlbrew</a></em>
    from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-perlbrew/">App::perlbrew</a>
    lets you create completely separate Perl environments. You do not need to
    upgrade the Perl your OS uses to try different versions of Perl. You can
    use multiple versions of Perl (maybe as you upgrade) across different
    projects. The separation from your system Perl makes server maintenance
    also much easier and you more confident about how your project is setup.
    Currently (March 2011) Win32/64 is not supported.
</p>
<p>
    <em><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN/scripts/cpan">cpan</a></em>
    from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN/">CPAN</a> has been
    distributed with Perl since 1997 (5.004). It has more options than cpanm,
    it is also much more verbose.
</p>
<p>
    <em><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPANPLUS/bin/cpanp">cpanp</a></em>
    from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPANPLUS/">CPANPLUS</a> has been
    distributed with Perl since 2007 (5.009). This offers even more options
    than cpanm or cpan.

<h2>
    Perl on Windows (Win32 and Win64)
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a> is a open source
    binary distribution of Perl for the Windows operating system. It includes a
    compiler and pre-installed modules that offer the ability to install XS
    CPAN modules directly from CPAN.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads">ActiveState</a>
    provide a binary distribution of Perl (for many platforms), as well as their
    own <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/ppm-perl-modules">perl
    package manager</a> (ppm). Some modules are not available as ppm's 
    or have reported errors on the ppm build system, this does not mean
    they do not work. You to use the <em>cpan</em> script and build modules 
    from CPAN against ActiveState Perl. 
</p>

<h2>Perl on Mac OSX</h2>
<p>
    OSX comes with Perl pre-installed, in order to build and install your
    own modules you will need to install the 'developer tools' which
    can be found on your OSX install CD. Once you have done this
    you can use all of the tools mentioned above.
</p>

<h2>Perl on Unix like OSs</h2>
<p>
    Install 'make' through your package manager. You can then
    use all of the tools mentioned above
</p>


<pre>
Plan:

MacOSX

- Install developer tools, then follow Unix like below

Unix like

- local::lib + cpanm
- perlbrew + cpanm
- CPAN and CPANPLUS

</pre>


<pre>
    # archive of any existing cpan configuration
    mv ~/.cpan ~/.cpan_original

    # Then one of the following:

    # if you can run wget
    wget -O - http://cpanmin.us/ | perl - local::lib App::cpanminus && \
    echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc

    # OR if you can run curl
    curl -L http://cpanmin.us/ | perl - local::lib App::cpanminus && \
    echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc

    # otherwise, download the contents of http://cpanmin.us to a file 
    # called cpanmin.us, make it executable and then run: 
    ./cpanmin.us local::lib App::cpanminus && \
    echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc
</pre>
