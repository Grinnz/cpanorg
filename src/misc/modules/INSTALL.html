<h1>How to install CPAN modules</h1>

<p>
    Here are some recommended approaches to installing modules from CPAN, as
    with much of Perl there are several alternatives.
</p>

<h2>
    Some basics
</h2>
<p>
    Most Perl modules are written in Perl, some use <a href=
    "http://perldoc.perl.org/perlxs.html">XS</a> (they are written in <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>) so require a
    C <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a>, see your OS
    of choice below to find out how to get the right compiler. Modules may have
    dependencies on other modules (almost always on <a href=
    "http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>) and cannot be installed without them (or
    without a specific version of them). It is worth throughly reading the
    documentation for the options below. Many modules on CPAN now require a
    recent version of Perl (version 5.8 or above).
</p>

<h2>
    Tools
</h2>
<p>
    To help you install and manage your modules:
</p>
<p>
    <em><a href=
    "http://search.cpan.org/dist/local-lib/">local::lib</a></em> this module enables
    you to install your module in a specified directory without requiring root
    or administrator access. See the <a href=
    "http://search.cpan.org/dist/local-lib/lib/local/lib.pm#The_bootstrapping_technique">
    bootstrapping technique</a> for how to get started. You can create a
    directory per user/project/company and deploy to other servers by copying the directory
    (as long as you are on the same operating system).
</p>

<p>
    <em><a href=
    "http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-cpanminus/bin/cpanm">cpanm</a></em> from
    <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-cpanminus/">App::cpanminus</a> is
    a script to get, unpack, build and install modules from CPAN. 
    It's dependency free (can bootstrap itself) and requires zero
    configuration. It automates the entire build process for the
    majority of modules on CPAN and works well with local::lib and perlbrew.
</p>
<p>
    <em><a href=
    "http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-perlbrew/bin/perlbrew">perlbrew</a></em>
    from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-perlbrew/">App::perlbrew</a>
    lets you create completely separate Perl environments. You do not need to
    upgrade the Perl your OS uses to try different versions of Perl. You can
    use multiple versions of Perl (maybe as you upgrade) across different
    projects. The separation from your system Perl makes server maintenance
    also much easier and you more confident about how your project is setup.
    Currently (March 2011) Win32/64 is not supported.

<p>
    <em><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN/scripts/cpan">cpan</em>
        from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN/">CPAN</a>
        has been distributed with Perl since 1997 (5.004).

    <em>CPANPLUS</em> - 2007 (5.009)
</p>

<h2>
    Win32
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a> is a binary
    distribution of Perl for the Windows operating system. It includes a
    bundled compiler and pre-installed modules that offer the ability to
    install XS CPAN modules directly from CPAN. 
</p>

<pre>
Plan:

Win32

- Strawberry + local::lib + cpanm
- ActiveState + ppm + CPAN + ?
- CPAN and CPANPLUS

MacOSX

- Install developer tools, then follow Unix like below

Unix like

- local::lib + cpanm
- perlbrew + cpanm
- CPAN and CPANPLUS

</pre>


<pre>
    # archive of any existing cpan configuration
    mv ~/.cpan ~/.cpan_original

    # Then one of the following:

    # if you can run wget
    wget -O - http://cpanmin.us/ | perl - local::lib App::cpanminus && \
    echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc

    # OR if you can run curl
    curl -L http://cpanmin.us/ | perl - local::lib App::cpanminus && \
    echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc

    # otherwise, download the contents of http://cpanmin.us to a file 
    # called cpanmin.us, make it executable and then run: 
    ./cpanmin.us local::lib App::cpanminus && \
    echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc
</pre>
