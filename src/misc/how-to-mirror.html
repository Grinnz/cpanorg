<p>
    You can mirror with an FTP client, but it's highly highly recommended that
    you use rsync.

    <a name="What_do_I_need" id="What_do_I_need">What do I need to mirror
    CPAN?</a>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>"Good" internet connectivity; if you are on a slow connection and won't
    offer the CPAN mirror for others to use, you might be better off just
    downloading what you need on demand or make a <a href=
    "http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Mini/">Mini CPAN</a> mirror.
    </li>
    <li>Around 10GB of storage space. <a href=
    "http://www.cpan.org/indices/du-k.gz">http://www.cpan.org/indices/du-k.gz</a>
    tells you the current size of the CPAN.
    </li>
    <li>An FTP or rsync client.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>For FTP there is a Perl script named mirror (which assumes a
            command line FTP client):<br>
                <a href=
                "http://sunsite.org.uk/packages/mirror/">http://sunsite.org.uk/packages/mirror/</a><br>
                <br>
                <b>The FTP address for the CPAN master site is:</b><br>
                <a href=
                "ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/">ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/</a><br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>and for rsync:<br>
                <a href=
                "http://rsync.samba.org/">http://rsync.samba.org/</a><br>
                <br>
                <b>The rsync addresses for the CPAN master site are:</b><br>
                <tt>ftp.funet.fi::CPAN</tt> or <tt>ftp.sedl.org::cpan</tt><br>
                <br>
                Once you have the rsync client installed on your system and the
                disk space mapped out, you may then add an entry to your
                crontab [ if using UNIX, AT if using Windows NT ] like the
                following example:<br>
                <br>
                <tt>0 20 * * * /usr/local/bin/rsync -av --delete
                ftp.funet.fi::CPAN /project/CPAN/</tt><br>
                <br>
                <tt>AT 20:00 /every:M,T,W,Th,F,S,Su "C:\Program
                Files\Rsync\rsync -av --delete ftp.funet.fi::CPAN
                /project/CPAN/"</tt>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Please make sure your rsync uses at least protocol version 30 ; use
            the command 'rsync --version' to find out. You can get the latest
            rsync from 'http://rsync.samba.org/'.
        </p>
        <p>
            About rsync frequency: once a day is fine and enough; once every
            hour is far, far too often.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

    mirror?</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The one that gives the best bandwidth (where your mirror finishes quickest)
    and which is most up-to-date. Most up-to-date is, by definition, the CPAN
    master site <tt>ftp.funet.fi</tt>. Note that it lives in the GMT+2 timezone
    so please try not to mirror during working hours: 0600 to 1400 GMT/UTC. If
    you want to mirror from somewhere else, check the list at <a href=
    "http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html">http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html</a>. If you
    are making a tool that needs the CPAN mirrors list (and you are able to
    load a JSON file), it might be easier to use the <a href=
    "http://www.cpan.org/indices/mirrors.json">mirrors.json</a> file.
</p>
<p>
    Please organize the mirroring with the corresponding FTP maintainer (their
    email addresses from the file <a href=
    "http://www.cpan.org/MIRRORED.BY">http://www.cpan.org/MIRRORED.BY</a>) so
    that you will not overload their site and that your mirror starts just
    after theirs has finished.
</p>
<p>
    A few tips to keep in mind:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>For your mirror site to be useful to your users you should mirror
    daily.
    </li>
    <li>You can also provide a HTTP interface in addition to an FTP interface
    to CPAN if you wish to do so.
    </li>
    <li>Consider also giving rsync access to your mirror. Many people like
    rsync because it's very bandwidth-friendly.
    </li>
    <li>Remember to tell cpan@perl.org about all the access methods you provide
    to your mirror: ftp, http, or rsync (or any other methods).
    </li>
</ul>

    If you want to publicize your CPAN mirror (meaning that your mirror is
    publicly available), please fill in the template which can be found from
    the top of the file <a href=
    "http://www.cpan.org/MIRRORED.BY">http://www.cpan.org/MIRRORED.BY</a>.
</p>
<p>
    There are plenty of examples of how to fill in the template file. When your
    template is ready, please send it to cpan@perl.org and you will be
    registered.
